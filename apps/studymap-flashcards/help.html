        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <p>Welcome to StudyMap! Below are answers to common questions about getting started and using key features. If you don't see your question, check the in-app Settings or contact <a href="mailto:support@momentum-apps.com">support@momentum-apps.com</a>.</p>

        <!-- Deck and Card Management -->
        <h2>Deck and Card Management</h2>
        <details>
            <summary>How do I add a new deck?</summary>
            <p>Tap the "+" button on the Decks screen (bottom navigation). Enter a name for your deck (e.g., "Biology Basics") in the text field. Tap "Save" to create it. Your new deck will appear in the list, ready for cards.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>How do I import a deck from a file?</summary>
            <p>From the Decks screen, tap the import icon or navigate to Import via the menu. Select "Choose File" and pick a CSV or Excel (.xls/.xlsx) file from your device. Preview the cards (front in column A, back in column B—headers are skipped). Edit the deck name if needed, then tap "Save." Invalid rows are ignored; errors show as toasts.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>How do I add a card to a deck?</summary>
            <p>Open a deck from the Decks screen to view its cards. Tap the "+" button. Fill in the "Front" (question/prompt) and "Back" (answer/explanation) fields. Select a difficulty level (Learning, Familiar, or Confident) from the dropdown. Tap "Save" to add it. Cards start with a default next review date for future SRS use.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>How do I edit or delete a card?</summary>
            <p>In a deck's card list, long-press a card or tap the edit icon. Update the front, back, or difficulty as needed, then tap "Update." To delete, use the overflow menu (three dots) on the card and select "Delete." Confirm to remove it permanently.</p>
        </details>

        <!-- Review Modes -->
        <h2>Review Modes</h2>
        <details>
            <summary>How do I start a manual review session?</summary>
            <p>Go to the Review tab (bottom navigation). Tap the "Manual Review" card. In the setup sheet, select decks, set the number of cards (via slider, up to total available), choose difficulties (or all), and toggle reverse order if you want backs shown first. Tap "Get Started" to begin swiping/flipping cards.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>How do I start a dictation review?</summary>
            <p>Similar to manual review: From the Review tab, tap "Dictation Review." Select decks, card count, difficulties, and reverse order in the setup sheet. Tap "Get Started." You'll see the front (or back if reversed) and type/speak to recall—tap to flip and check against the back.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>What is SRS Review, and how does it work?</summary>
            <p>SRS (Spaced Repetition System) is a smart review mode (launching soon) that schedules cards based on your performance to boost long-term retention. In the Review tab, tap "SRS Review." Select decks to see new vs. due cards. Rate cards as Hard/Good/Easy during sessions—the app adjusts intervals automatically using your custom multipliers (set in Settings).</p>
        </details>

        <!-- Settings -->
        <h2>Settings</h2>
        <details>
            <summary>How do I change the app's theme?</summary>
            <p>Open Settings (bottom navigation). Tap the "Dark Mode" card. Choose System (follows device), Light, or Dark from the options. The app restarts to apply changes. This affects backgrounds, cards, and UI elements for better readability.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>How do I change the app's language?</summary>
            <p>In Settings, tap the "Language" card. Select English or Spanish (more coming soon). The app restarts to update all text, including card labels and menus. Your locale persists across sessions.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>How do I customize SRS intervals?</summary>
            <p>In Settings, tap "SRS Intervals." Adjust the base interval (days between reviews, min 1), and multipliers (Hard: 1.0+, Good: higher than Hard, Easy: highest—e.g., 1.2x, 2.0x, 4.0x). Ensure multipliers increase logically to avoid errors. Tap "Save SRS Settings" to apply. These tune how "easy" cards space out for optimal learning.</p>
